## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the utilization patterns of EV charging stations. It focuses on:

* Identifying high-demand hours
* Monitoring queue lengths
* Calculating session durations
* Spotting overloaded stations
* Recommending new charging point locations

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data processing
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for charts
* **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis

## 📊 Key Insights

1️⃣ Peak Usage Hours

Charging stations show the highest demand during evening hours (6 PM – 9 PM).
This indicates that users prefer charging after work hours, leading to heavy congestion.

2️⃣ Station-Wise Utilization

Some stations consistently show higher session counts and longer queues, meaning they are heavily used.
Such stations require additional charging points or capacity expansion.

3️⃣ Queue Length Patterns

Stations with long queue lengths indicate:

High vehicle traffic

Insufficient number of chargers

Delays in user charging time
These stations need priority attention.

4️⃣ Session Duration Insights

Average session duration helps understand:

How long users spend at charging points

Which time slots take longer processing
Stations with longer session durations face more bottlenecks.

5️⃣ Hour-wise Trend Analysis

Hourly data shows clear usage patterns:

Morning hours have low demand

Midday increases slightly

Evenings show peak load
This pattern helps plan staffing and maintenance.

6️⃣ Recommended Locations for New Chargers

Based on queue length + peak hours + session count, certain stations show high pressure score, making them ideal candidates for:

New charging points

Station expansion

Improved infrastructure

7️⃣ Real-time Insights for Decision Making

The analysis helps identify:

Busy stations

Idle stations

Underutilized locations

Demand forecasting
This directly supports operational optimization and better resource allocation.
